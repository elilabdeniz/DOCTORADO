 <p>
Giving a good academic talk takes effort.
</p>

<p>
I'm not a master public speaker, and I've met my quota of bad academic talks.

But, I'm better than I was when I started.

And, I improve every year.

<p> Since my own students are starting to give talks now, I thought I'd
share what I've learned (the hard way) over the years:  </p>


<ol>

 <li>
 The audience determines the talk. 
 </li>

 <li>
 Practice almost makes perfect.
 </li>

 <li>
 Nervous energy is exploitable.
 </li>

 <li>
 Every talk should motivate a problem.
 </li>

<li>
 An academic talk is about an idea, not a paper.
 </li>

 <li>
 Slides must not overwhelm the viewer.
 </li>

 <li>
 Images and diagrams are better than text. 
 </li>

 <li>
 Math's benefit must outweigh the loss of attention.
 </li>

 <li>
 Style matters.
 </li>

 <li>
 Questions are not random.
 </li>


</ol>

I've since found these insights and more in

It's a short afternoon read. Anyone that does technical speaking should have it.

  <h1>Audience</h1>


<p>
The biggest mistake academics make is misjudging their audience.
</p>

<p> I've been to (many) talks where the talk itself was presented
to one or two people in a room of hundreds.  </p>

<p>
(Disclaimer: I've given my fair share of these talks too.)
</p>

<p>When preparing a talk, glance at the program for the event, or ask your host
what you should expect of the audience in terms of background knowledge.</p>

<p>
Aim appropriately.
</p>

<p> When we speak on favored topics, our instinct is to gloss over concepts and
details that once took us the better part of grad school to
understand.</p>

<p>
It feels awkward, or even insulting, to recap "introductory" material.
</p>

<p>
There's also a negative feedback mechanism in academic culture.
</p>

<p> When you present to a broader audience, experts
in your own specialty will claim to be annoyed and chastise  
you in public Q &amp; A to stroke their egos.  </p>

<p>
Don't listen to them.  You're not presenting to just them.
</p>

<p>
Always ask:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>What needs to be understood to convey the big idea?</li>
 <li>What can I expect the audience to already know?</li>
</ul>




<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>
Practice is the key to a "natural" delivery.
</p>

<p>
I have to practice ten times before I hit diminishing returns.
</p>

<p> Keep in mind that you're not trying to memorize a talk.  You're rehearsing
its presentation.  Memorizing a talk would take too much practice.</p>

<p>
The good news is that not all practice has to be in front of a small group.
</p>

<p>
Practice a talk alone a lot, and then once or twice with a group.
</p>

<p> The advantage of practicing with a small group is that it's 
harder to speak to a small group than a large audience.  </p>

<p> Concentrate practice on your opening,
since a smooth opening sets up a successful talk. 
The shower is a great place to practice openings.</p>

<p>
Consider recording later practice talks, and listen to them for
awkward transitions, slides that run too long or inadequate explanations.
</p>

<p>
If the transition from one topic to another is awkward, add a slide in the middle to make it more gradual.
(Keynote transition animations can signal how abrupt the transition is going to be.)
</p>

<p>
If a slide runs long (more than 30-60 seconds), break it into multiple slides.
</p>

<p> If you feel you're not explaining a concept well, first consider whether
the concept is essential.  If it's not, just cut it out.  
Otherwise, lengthen the explanation and add more slides.</p>




<h2>Nerves</h2>

<p>
Public speaking is a common fear.
</p>

<p> It <em>is</em> possible to eliminate that fear through <em>extensive</em> experience.

But, until you get rid 
of it, you'll have to learn to <em>exploit</em> it.  </p>

<p>
Most folks get "nerves" or "the jitters" before a big talk because there is a natural fear of embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
The body misinterprets that fear as an existential crisis.
</p>

<p>
It releases adrenaline.
Higher reasoning slows.
Reactions go autonomic.
</p>

<p>
(That's why practice is critical: your talk must be instinct.)
</p>

<p>
Some adrenaline is good.  Too much will leave you a chattering mess.
</p>

<p>
Understanding your biology allows you to take advantage of it. 
</p>

<p>
You need to regulate and exploit your adrenaline. 
</p>

<p> Vigorous activity--I like doing push-ups--is an effective way to manage
adrenaline.  Even if you can't do many push-ups, you'll be able to
crank them out right before you give a talk.  </p>

<p> I once gave a TV interview on 45 minutes' notice.   I
hadn't shaved that day, and I needed to grab presentable clothes.  I spent
those 45 minutes <em>literally</em> running to get what I needed to go on
camera.  </p>

<p>
When the reporter walked in, I felt exhausted.
</p>

<p> When I saw the interview on TV, I was stunned: it was the most confident and
natural-sounding TV interview I'd ever given.  </p>


<p> If you're feeling nerves during the day of the talk, cut them off with music.  I prefer
"epic" music--the kind you find in soundtracks for battle scenes.  Find music
that works for you.  If it has drums or bass that sync with a normal
heartbeat, it can slow down a racing heart.</p> 


<p>
If you find your heart racing right before a talk, take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can.
Exhale slowly and take another.
Repeat until your heart slows down.
(It has to slow down eventually.)
</p>


<p>
Over the past four years, I've given fifty public talks (and countless classroom lectures which don't count).
</p>

<p>
With each talk, my pre-talk nerves diminished.
</p>

<p>
As I was about to give the fourtieth talk, I noticed I <em>didn't</em> feel nervous.
</p>

<p>
After enough talks, the fear just goes away.
</p>

<p>
I say this as an introvert too shy to even call on the phone until college.
</p>




<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
Every talk needs motivation: Why should the audience grant you attention?
</p>

<p>
Avoid the standard cliches that everyone has heard.
</p>

<p>
I opened a recent talk on automating a technique in my research with:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/motive.png">
 <br>
 <em>(As adapted from Hilary Mason's shell-script goal.)</em>
</div>



<p> One of the best academic talks I have ever heard spent over half the alloted
time motivating why something that was assumed to be a long-solved problem was not a solved problem.
</p>

<p>
None of the academic solutions had made a 
dent in practice.  </p>

<p> I often have two motivations for my work--the "top-down" motivation and the
"bottom-up" motivation.  </p>

<p> A top-down motive is one that the taxpayer
should care about: why some research ultimately solves a
problem of societal importance.  </p>

<p>
These end with "safer software," "more efficient cars" and "cures cancer."
</p>

<p> The bottom-up motive is an argument for the intellectual challenge of the
problem or the elegance of its solution.  
</p>

<p> These motives sound like, "If we can do X via Y, and X is similar to
Z, can we do Z via Y or something Y-like?" or "There are four possible
combinations of two attributes, but so far we only have a name for three of
those combinations; what is the fourth like?" </p>

<p>
A bottom-up motivation situates the contribution to human knowledge.
</p>

<p> Not every talk has to have both kinds of motivation, but thinking of a
contribution in top-down and bottom-up terms helps find one
to present to the target audience.  </p>



<h2>The idea</h2>

<p>
There's a misconception that an academic talk based on a paper has to be a lecture
on what's in the paper.
</p>

<p>
It takes hours of thoughtful reading to digest the average paper in detail.
</p>

<p>
At best, a talk can catalyze that digestion; it cannot replace it.
</p>

<p>
The talk should present the same idea in the paper, but on its own terms.
</p>

<p>
After you've rehearsed your talk, ask the following questions:
</p>

<ul> 

 <li>Could a listener remember the motivation?</li>

 <li>Could a listener state the main idea?</li>

 <li>Could a listener summarize the talk in three sentences?</li>

 <li>Could a motivated listener recreate the result in three weeks?</li>

 <li>Would a listener know when to consult the paper?</li>

</ul>




<h2>Slides</h2>

<p>
PowerPoint has kneecapped public speaking.
</p>

<p>
People no longer "deliver a <em>speech</em>"; they "present <em>slides</em>."
</p>

<p>
PowerPoint encourages bad habits and even makes new ones possible.
</p>

<p>
Chief among them is visual infoglut.
</p>

<p>
In my earlier talks, I was no saint in this regard.
</p>

<p>
Sitting in the audience during other talks, I've realized that 
my brain shuts off when too much information is up on a slide.
</p>

<p> Too much information means not much beyond three short bullet points.
</p>

<p> I've since switched to a style where the majority of my slides contain at
most a single line of text, or nothing but a diagram.  </p>

<p> If I have to present a large diagram, I present it node by node and edge by
edge, using the animation features of Keynote to avoid overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
I used to create slides like this:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/badslide1.png">
</div>

<p>
These days, I would break this information into five or six slides.
</p>

<p>
Three years ago, I restricted my text to three <em>short</em> bullet points:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/betterslide1.png">
</div>

<p>
That's about as much information as I like to have on a slide.
</p>

<p>
But, the majority of my slides now contain only a single line; for example:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/betterslide2.png">
</div>

<p> I'm not saying this is the only way to give a good talk, but I have found
that constraining the information I have on a slide guarantees the audience can
follow, and it forces me to structure the talk as a linear narrative. </p>

<p> It aids flow. </p>


<p>
After you've rehearsed a talk, ask yourself:
</p>

<ul> 

 <li>Was there a slide where I spent too much time talking?</li>

 <li>Was there a slide I could have done without?</li>

</ul>

<p>
Expand or cull as necessary.
</p>

<h2>Imagery</h2>

<p> One of the good things about modern presentation software is that it
enables imagery and diagrams that were not possible not long ago.  </p>

<p>
Wherever an image suffices to convey an idea, I prefer it to text.
</p>

<p>
But, images and diagrams can also become too complex.
</p>

<p> I build up diagrams node by node and edge by edge using the
animation facilities provided by the software.  </p>

<p>
Even for the following diagram, I used four slides connected by animations:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/diagram1.png">
</div>


<p>
I've heard from psychologists that a diagram with seven components is about as large
as you can get before viewers can't keep the whole diagram in their head.
That seems true in my experience.
</p>

<p> Visual symmetry allows mental compression, 
doubling the size of diagrams that viewers can attend to.  
It even aids comprehension.</p>


<p>
A Tuftean trick is to avoid needless embellishment on charts.
</p>

<p> For instance, in many cases, the shape of a plot matters much more than the
specific values on the plot; that is, what's of interest is whether some agent
is growing exponentially, linearly, quadratically, etc.  </p>

<p> Whenever that is the case, I omit axes, scales and tick marks: I draw just
the lines or bars themselves.  </p>




<h2>Math</h2>

<p>
The hardest part of giving a good technical talk is not using much math.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics is an expressive and precise language.
</p>

<p> Even for experts, it takes time for a reader to parse and translate
mathematics into internal mental concepts.  </p>

<p>
Because of the mental effort involved, reading mathematics disengages the reader from  the speaker.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics must be used sparingly.
</p>

<p>
When I got to this slide in my first talk, I accidentally ended it:
</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/badslide2.png">  
</div>

<p> Not only could I have defined the function "local-inlinable" in plain
english (or with a diagram), the condition on thes slide takes minutes to
unwind.  I gave my audience 30 seconds.  
</p>

<p>
Mentally, everyone abandoned ship.</p>

<p> These days, as a rule, I use animation to make sure that when I use math, I
never introduce more than 4-7 symbols at a time.  </p>

<p>
Each equation receives its own slide.
</p>

<p>
Few people learn mathematics straight from formal definitions.
</p>

<p>
The mind is an engine for inferring the general from the specific. 
</p>

<p> Where possible, I define a concept in terms of a few examples, and let the
reader's mind interpolate the general definition.  
It feels dirty, but it works!</p>

<p>
I now ask the following questions of any math I use in a talk:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>Is understanding this math essential to the idea?</li>
 <li>Is there no way to use a diagram or analogy instead?</li>
 <li>Is there no way to use plain english instead?</li>
 <li>Is it infeasible to infer the concept with examples?</li>
</ol>

<p> If the answer to all four questions is "Yes," 
I'll use math.  If not, I don't. </p>


<p>
I've found that I can cut out almost all of the mathematics from my talks.
</p>


<p>
The feedback from audiences has been positive.
</p>

<p> Just to convince the audience that there is a formalism for the
work, I sometimes have one slide at the end with most of the mathematics:</p>

<div class="graphic">
 <img width="400" src="./10 tips on how to give an academic talk_files/mathslide1.png">
</div>



<h2>Style</h2>


<p>
Something that's surprised me is the degree to which an audience will soak in style and polish.
</p>

<p> The choice of font, the lack of gratuitous visual adornment, the balancing
of whitespace, and the effort to use intuition-guiding animations 
affects the feedback I get from the audience after a talk.  </p>

<p> The effect is so pronounced that I switched from LaTeX
 to Keynote for preparing slides.  </p>

<p> As a researcher in programming languages, I tend to have a reductionist
attitude about languages: every class of problem should be solved  by
creating an expressive language for describing solutions.  </p>

<p> Presentations are a strong counter-example to my viewpoint.
It's much easier to create high-quality presentations in Keynote than in LaTeX.</p>

<p> I think the slideshow package in <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> holds a lot of promise for the
linguistic development of high-impact presentations, but it's not there yet.
</p>


<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>
Q &amp; A handling improves with experience.
</p>

<p>
I've managed to get better by anticipating questions. 
</p>

<p>
By giving practice talks to small groups, you'll find a core set of questions.
</p>

<p> Some answers belong in your talk, but those that require
lengthier or off-topic diversions can be reserved for a special slide.  </p>


<p> Twice, I've managed to anticipate not only the questions asked but also the
questioner that asked them.

 I even prepare an answer slide that includes the likely questioner's name.  </p>


<p> For handling unanticipated questions, buy time by reformulating the question
as you understand it.  </p>

<p> If an exchange lasts long or becomes hostile, thank the questioner and ask
to move the discussion after the talk.  </p>



<h2>Miscellaneous tips</h2>

<ul>

 <li>
 If you can open with short, clean, original and <em>relevant</em> humor, do it.
 <br><br>

 I recently gave a public talk on information security and spoke after an FBI agent.

 The agent opened with a childhood story.

 <br><br> 

 I started my talk with, "I was also going to tell you a story about information security from my childhood, but I just realized I'm sitting next to an FBI agent, and I forgot to check the statute of limitations."

 <br><br>

 Light-hearted self-deprecation usually works well.

 </li>

 <li>
 Never use humor you haven't tested on a practice audience.
 </li>

 <li>
 Video record your talks and watch them.  It's painful but worth it.
 </li>

 <li>
 Never use Comic Sans in a technical talk.  
 I am a Comic Sans bigot.
 There are others.
 </li>

 <li>
 Gesture with your whole body.
 </li>

 <li>
 Step away from the podium.
 </li>

 <li>
 Use the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPGP4U?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ucmbread-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FPGP4U">Kensington remote</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ucmbread-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000FPGP4U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; display: none !important;">.

  It's sleek and ergonomic, and it's the only one without an easy to press "screw up my talk" button.

 </li>

 <li>
 Pay attention to what you like and don't like in other presentations.
 </li>

 <li>
  Code is the same as math in terms of mental effort.
  Use it sparingly.
 </li>



 </ul>
